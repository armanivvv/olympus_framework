# Culture

Every company needs to create and maintain it's own culture. Olympus docs 
offer a pattern to document your company and it's processes. One of the 
biggest mistakes is neglecting your documentation until it's too late. 

Olympus views process as iterative. It's important that it's constantly 
changing. This area is the place where your developers and perhaps other
departments can come and check to make sure they are not missing any steps in
their work. 

Runbooks or checklists are highly encouraged to be created and maintained.
