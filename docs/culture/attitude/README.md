# Attitude

The attitude of the company and the employees is the most important point of
culture. The difference between a good and bad attitude could easily spell the
difference between success and failure. 


### Managing your attitude
People's attitude changes all the time. It can be work, home, family, or caused
by thousands of other items. It would be unfair to demand a perfect attitude
at all times. But by being transparent and open we can keep the companies 
attitude positive.


### Can't / Impossible
Bad words. This isn't to mean we have to be dictators about the words and call
them out everytime they are said. However we should be very careful to describe
our desired features or outcomes as not achievable. Our competitors may not
put that limitation on themselves. 

### Blame
Everyone is at fault. Period. All failures are everyones failures and all 
successes are jointly accredited. Thus trying to blame an individual or pass
fault on someone is counter productive. If you find yourself blaming others,
raise those concerns so we can address the issues. Perhaps the person being 
blamed has other more important priorities or items that is causing them to 
miss your deadlines. Or they may be having other issues that demand 
compassion and not vitriol.
